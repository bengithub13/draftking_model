spring-context-4.0.0.RELEASE
spring-core-4.0.0.RELEASE
spring-tx-3.0.5.RELEASE
spring-web-4.0.0.RELEASE

i also had to remove from the build path the activemq core 5.2 jar else i get type mismatch exception:
 Object of type [class org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory] available at JNDI location
  [java:comp/env/jms/ConnectionFactory] is not assignable to [org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory].
